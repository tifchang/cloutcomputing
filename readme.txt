### Understanding Trump's tweet performance through text mining

This analysis was conducted in R using text mining concepts and practices on the past 400 tweets from Trump's personal account [@realDonaldTrump](http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump). 

This analysis focuses on Trump but samples from other Top 10 Twitter accounts in order to compare and contrast Trump's account with other high performing accounts. I chose two types of accounts within and outside the same domain: pop culture figures and political figures. Using the *twitteR* packages, I access [@katyperry](http://twitter.com/katyperry), [@KimKardashian](http://twitter.com/KimKardashian), [@BarackObama](http://twitter.com/barackobama), and [@realDonaldTrump](http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump)'s posts. Lastly, to add a new dimension to Trump's model, I will be scraping  [Presidential Approval Ratings](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/popularity.php)over time.
