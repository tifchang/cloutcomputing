            Understanding and forecasting Trump's Twitter performance
        </h2>

    <div class="spacer-5em"></div>
    <h2 class="title is-5">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        How does Trump gain followers and so much engagement on Twitter? What specifically about his posts are engaging 
        and have contributed to his dominant Twitter following? This analysis aims to uncover
        the truth and reveal tactics underlying his tweets. Through this analysis, I also hope to reveal patterns, similaries, and 
        differences between Trump's tweets and other high performing users. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer-3em"></div><hr><div class="spacer-3em"></div>
    <h2 class="title is-5">Data Sources</h2>
    <p>
        This analysis focuses on Trump but samples from other Top 10 Twitter accounts in order to compare and contrast Trump's 
        account with other high performing accounts. I chose two types of accounts within and outside the same domain: 
        pop culture figures and political figures. Using the <code>twitteR</code> packages, I 
        access <a href="http://twitter.com/katyperry">@katyperry</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/KimKardashian">@KimKardashian</a>,
        <a href="http://twitter.com/barackobama">@BarackObama</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump">@realDonaldTrump</a>'s posts.
        <br><br>
        Lastly, to add a new dimension to Trump's model, I will be scraping  
        <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/data/popularity.php">Presidential Approval Ratings</a> over time.

    <h2 class="title is-5">Do people gravitate towards positive tweets?</h2>
    <p>
        Looking into sentiment analysis across various users' tweets, I gained a broader understanding of the emotions 
        users conveyed through their tweets. Intuitively, people would gravitate towards tweets that were either informative or 
        made them feel good (positive/uplifting). But this analysis proves otherwise. <br><br>
        First, I analyzed pop culture icons like Katy Perry and Kim Kardashian and showed that they focus on promotional tweets, positive 
        personal tweets, or uplifting feel-good tweets (cheesy one-liner life wisdom quotes). These tweets, especially the 
        personal tweets, have performed highest.

            From a qualitative point of view, Katy Perry's account is dynamically positive. That means, she uses 
            her account to tweet positive messages across a variety of domains including general wellbeing messages (as seen above)
            her everyday life, music, and judging on American Idol. However, she has a large set of neutral tweets 
            as a lot of her content is also general promotional material.

            Similar to Katy Perry's tweets, Kim Kardashian typically tweets about positive topics 
            such as her family, as well as promotional tweets for her latest makeup line. 
            Her highest performing tweets are those with images of her family, as seen to the left, and 
            "feel good" tweets.

        However, Donald Trump's recent debut on Twitter in the past year has introduced a new dynamic of Twitter usage that has 
        gained interest. The transparency with his thoughts and emotions has garnered traction to his platform. Social media 
        has been criticized to be a platform for perfected perceptions put up by users. However, Trump gains traction through his dynamic 
        sentiment and candor. As seen through the sentiment analysis, Trump exhibits a wider range and frequency of fluctuting emotional valence.

        I wanted to baseline this to that of another political figure and chose Barack Obama. As seen through his tweets' sentiment analysis, 
        Barack Obama's tweets also deviate from neutral sentiment frequently but not with as much magnitude as Trump's. Diving more into the 
        content of his positive and negative tweets, I saw that Obama's tweets were more remorseful towards victims and sad versus angry and bitter. Below are 
        examples of his tweets and emotional valence. Political figures tend to show more variation in sentiment.

        With the limitations of the Twitter API as well as most of the chosen users' contents contaminated with 
        sponsored promotional content, it was difficult to emerge with a variety of topics. For example, Katy Perry's 
        tweets showed to be only promotional content for American Idol. 
        Given the limited topics, it was difficult to do a compare &amp; contrast analysis across types of users but 
        interesting to see the clean cut topics among political figures. Political figures seem to be more dynamic in their 
        topics in comparison to pop culture figures.

    <h2 class="title is-5">Forecasting Trump's Tweets</h2>
    <p>
            Going into model building, I initially wanted to build a model that would predict the Presidential Approval Rating for 
            Trump based off data extracted from his tweets, both observed and underlying statistics about the tweet (i.e., number of retweets, sentiment, etc.). 
            However, given the constraints of the Twitter API, I was not able to pull tweets from a larger variety of weeks. Therefore, the 
            Presidential Approval Rating (which is calculated by week) were the same for each week (and did not vary much from week to week) and 
            were not as interesting to predict given the constraints. Therefore, I wanted to build a model that would predict a tweet's performance 
            given specific keywords as well as other factors such as links and that week's approval rating. However, after trying various models, 
            I could not emerge with a model that had strong predictive power. <br><br>
            I ran a linear and KNN model with Retweet Count as the dependent variable and a selection of keywords and other observed variables as 
            independent variables. Variables were chosen to be in the model if they provided significant explanatory power. This was determined by the 
            p values of the variables as coefficients in the regression.


            All models had poor RMSE values; the linear model had the lowest RMSE value at 7318.424, while KNN was 7471.77. 
            The residual plots are shown below. 
    </p>
    <div class="spacer-3em"></div>
    <h3 class="title is-6">Errors across Models</h3>

    </div>
    <p> <br>
        While the linear model shows lower RMSE, the model seem to be always overshooting the true values. On the other hand, the KNN model 
        shows variation around the true value as certain predictions are nearly spot on while others are drastically off in either direction. 
        Unfortunately, the models were not accurate enough to predict retweets. <br> <br>
        Predicting success in social systems remains an area <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2883001">still in exploration</a>. Even more specifically,
        even with a substantial amount of data, it's still difficult to predict. There is a lot of uncertainty and variables that surround 
        user engagement with Twitter posts. Logically, there is variation in the heterogeneous preferences and underlying reasons users 
        engage with a post that is difficult to account for given the current models and variables.

    <div class="spacer-3em"></div><hr><div class="spacer-3em"></div>
    <h2 class="title is-5">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Trump has a strong and controversial personality. However, this energy has gained significant attention on Twitter. On Google trends, 
        Trump's popularity and internet interest is roughly 10x that of Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Obama. Though this analysis specifically dove 
        into understanding Trump through text mining, it would be interesting going forward to be able to forecast his approval ratings or even 
        specific stock prices as news sources have said that his tweets significantly impact company stock prices when he tweets about one. However, 
        predicting social media performance remains an unanswered question and can also be further explored.  
        Nonetheless, Trump's dynamic sentiments and controversial content keep our feeds interesting and never fails to engage, whether good or bad.
